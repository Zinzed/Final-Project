# Final-Project

Light Polite Mammal Mundane Community - Team #1

A user-friendly application for artists to help them build their portfolios and connect with other artists on the platform for inspiration and networking.

# Sprint 1 - Create an ambiguous working profile page that incorporates the use of 1 basic portfolio template





# Product Goal
By April, we will have created a user-friendly website to help artists create and share portfolios. Including 3 templates to choose from and a way for extra advertising to promote their portfolio to others. Users will also be able to copy the link for their profile for easy sharing. Additionally, our platform will also be an effective way for artists to connect with one another and gather inspiration. To support this idea, there will be a chat system, and a vast explore page with different art styles where you can browse othersâ€™ portfolios.

# Definition of done
- Code meets agreed upon quality standards (pep 8 and camel case)
- Code has been tested based upon requirements (passed automated testing and code validator)
- Reviewed by peers
- Feedback implemented (if need be)
- Approved by peers
- Does not break existing site and no known bugs

When a goal is completed several requirements should be met. Code should both be tested by and pass automated testing and a code validator. It should also follow pep 8 and camel case. The code or design should also be reviewed and approved by peers to both check over any errors and so that everyone understands how it has been implemented. Feedback will also be implemented if applicable. Finally, nothing should break when done and there should be no known bugs.
